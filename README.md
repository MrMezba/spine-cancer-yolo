# Deep learning object detection-based Hierarchical Fuzzy model to early detection of Spinal Metastatic Bone Cancer

## Description
This repository introduces a complete deep learning model for detecting and classifying spine metastatic bone cancer from CT scan images. The method combines modern YOLO-based object detection models with a hierarchical fuzzy logic–based decision system to improve reliability, especially when predictions are uncertain or unclear.

The system classifies spine CT images into three clinically significant categories: **Normal**, **Lytic**, and **Blastic**. Multiple YOLO architectures are implemented and evaluated to ensure comprehensive performance comparison and reproducibility.
